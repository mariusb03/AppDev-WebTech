# Instructions
Experiment with this Example:
1. Download this project 
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run it
4. Open your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/hello . You should see a `"Hello, World"` message. 
5. Now open http://localhost:8080/users/list in your browser. What do you see appearing in the browser?
6.	Go to class `GreetingController` and just scan through it. Do you get an intuitive understanding of where the `"Hello, World"` comes from? 
7.	Can you try to change the source code so that the page shows `"Hei, World"` instead of `"Hello, World"`?
8.	Check out the class `UserController`. Without going into details â€“ see how easy it is to return a list of users which get translated to a proper JSON representation of the user list by Spring framework?
